  <h1>About</h1>




<p> Hi, my name is Adam Newton Wright. I am a university student of physics. This website started out of my desire to learn programming. I decided to merge this desire, along with my love of physics, to create this website.</p>

<p> I'm not exactly sure where this website is headed, but for now I thought it would be fun to post something interesting about physics. Some fact, or history, or equation, that I believe is fundamental, or crazy, or wild. So here it is.
