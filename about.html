  <h1>About</h1>


<p> Hi. My name is Adam Newton Wright. </p>

<p> This website started simply as a way for me to learn how to create a website. Programming is pretty fun, and I always thought it would be cool to publish a website. I also really enjoy physics, so I thought I would post some cool physics topics. I will try to continually post more, and if you have any ideas, I would love to hear them.</p>
