<p>This is the Lorenz Attractor. It is names after its founder, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz">Edward Lorenz</a>, a twentieth century mathematician and pioneer of chaos theory. Anyway, this system is interesting, and quite frankly birthed a new branch of physics, nonlinear dynamics.</p>

<p> The equations that describe the motion of this system are

where historically a = 10, b = 8/3, and c = 28. This system exhibits a phenomen coined chaos. This word is thrown around a lot carelessly. Chaos is a system that displays strong sensitivity to initial conditions, has aperiodic orbits, and are topologically transitive. The first property means that a particle that starts at one point will have a very different trajectory than a particle that starts at a different point. The second means that the particle will not shoot of to infitity, and will not settle down to a fixed point, but will have some complex trajectory that keeps repeating. The third is a little confusing, but means that points that start out together will get stretched out along a set.

Here is a cool little simulation. Feel free to play around with it (but if you change the parameters, you have to refresh the page, sorry). It gives you a nice idea of these wild trajectories that chaotic systems have.

<p> Now, you may think that the trajectory of these particles are completely random, but this is not true. Physical systems can be classied into two systems: deterministic and nondeterministic. A deterministic system is that which the outcome can be known before the experiment is performed; for example, if a ball is dropped from some height, we can calculate when the ball will reach the ground.</p>

<p> Nondeterministic systems, on the other hand, or systems in which we cannot know the outcome before the experiment is performed. You may be less familiar with these kinds of systems, as they are not a part of our everyday life. The classic example is the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Stern and Gerlach sent particles, like little tiny atoms, in between the north and south pole of a magnet; the magnet had an inhomogeneous magnetic field, but let's not dive into that. Anyway, because particles have something called spin, they can interact with the magnetic field and either be deflected upwards or downwards. The thing is, before we send the partile through the magnet, we cannot know if it will be deflected up or down because we cannot know if it has spin up or spin down. Thus, the system is said to be nondeterministic, because we don't know what is going to happen.</p>

<p>This system, the Lorenz system, is special because it is deterministic by nature. There is no part of the equations that say "now flip a coin to decide where to go." However, you'll notice in the photo that these lines will go around these orbits for a while and then jump randomly to the other orbit. We cannot know which orbit the particle will be on! Thus, this deterministic system somehow hides information from us. And now a lot of physicists are studying these sytems to try to squeeze some information from them.</p>
